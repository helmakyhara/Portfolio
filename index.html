                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hey there! I'm Helma, here is a little about my educational journey: I graduated from Middlesex University with a Product Design Engineering Degree, yet still with an eagerness to deepen my knowledge and set myself new challenges. Even though I graduated as a design engineer, I realised I had a major drive to learn more in the areas of technology, specifically programming. Since completing my degree, I began to self-study using educational tools such as Udemy, learning a variety of languages such as Java, Python, HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript and Git. Graduating in my specialised area has sparked and facilitated my interest as I continue to learn, understand and achieve greater knowledge in programming and its languages.

                        Since I have completed a challenging engineering course and have widened my skills in computer languages, I am eager to enter the world of work where I may advance and become a reputable professional inside a business and have the chance to be a well-rounded developer. I want to apply my knowledge and enthusiasm for technological innovation to help a firm grow while actively participating in the innovation process.

                <h3>IT Career Switch - Trainee</h3> 
                <h4>Mar 2023 - Present</h4>
                <p>I am currently a trainee at ITCareer Switch, where I am learning a range of coding languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. I am studying the fundamental
                    understanding of the most vital front-end programming languages as well as popular back-end programming language. I will be completing a series of small projects, that will put my skills to the test. This will ready me for the independent projects I will tackle in future roles.
                    I will also be completing 2 real-world projects to showcase to employers my knowledge of practical applications of the coding languages. The projects take on real-world scenarios where I will solve and will simulate similar projects that I will encounter when working as a future Developer.
